## üé® Customization

## Adding New RSS Sources

1.  Locate the relevant feed array in the JavaScript section:

    javascript

    `const generalFeeds =  [...];  const premiumTechFeeds =  [...];  const mediumFeeds =  [...];  `

2.  Add your RSS feed URL to the appropriate array

3.  Test to ensure the feed works with RSS2JSON service

## Modifying Article Count

Adjust the numbers in the main fetch function:

javascript

`let generalArticles =  await  fetchBalancedArticles(generalFeeds,  3,  "General Tech");  let premiumArticles =  await  fetchBalancedArticles(premiumTechFeeds,  5,  "Premium Tech");  let mediumArticles =  await  fetchBalancedArticles(mediumFeeds,  2,  "Medium");  `

## Styling Customization

Modify CSS custom properties in the¬†`:root`¬†selector:

css

`:root  {    --primary: #2563eb;    --primary-hover: #1d4ed8;    --bg: #f8fafc;    /* ... other variables */  }  `

## üîç Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

No Articles Loading

- Check internet connection

- Verify RSS2JSON service is accessible

- Clear browser cache and reload

Quality Score Always Low

- RSS feeds may be temporarily unavailable

- Fallback articles will be used automatically

Mobile Display Issues

- Ensure viewport meta tag is present
